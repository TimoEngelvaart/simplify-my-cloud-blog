I'm **Timo Engelvaart**, a DevOps engineer from the Netherlands and the creator of **Simplify My Cloud**.
<br/><br/>
I work daily with **Azure** and the **Power Platform**â€”automating real processes for municipalities and teams. Here I share the exact **patterns, scripts, and blueprints** I use so you can copy, adapt, and ship faster.
<br/><br/>
**What you'll find here**
- Step-by-step builds for Azure & Power Platform  
- Copy-paste snippets (PowerShell, Azure Functions, GitHub Actions)  
- Opinionated, production-ready setups that stay simple
